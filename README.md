## Introduction

The DiRe-CFD (Dispersion Resampling - Computational Fluid Dynamics) library implements a new numerical scheme for simulating fluid flow. The method - unlike previous ones - is not restricted spatially, can be computed with varying local precision/detail across time and space, while having O(k*n) computational complexity (where "n" is the number of simulated "nodes", "k" is a constant factor).
